# Star Patterns JavaScript 

While learning programming concepts Star pattern is used to test different programming skills like looping, conditional statements, etc. The program is to display a pattern of stars. Star patterns can be created in any programming language, however here we are going to use JavaScript.

It is a series of stars (*) which creates a certain pattern or geometrical shape such as a square, pyramid, triangle, etc. These patterns are created using some nested controlled loops.

The pattern programs are used to practice and boost programming skills like JavaScript loops and are also asked to create in programming interviews.
